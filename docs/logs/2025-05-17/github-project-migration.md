# GitHub Project Migration

Date: 2025-05-17

## üìã Overview

This document provides a guide for migrating all epics and user stories to GitHub Projects for improved tracking and management.

## üéØ Goals

- Create a structured GitHub Project for AI Assistant development
- Configure custom fields for tracking type, priority, story points, and components
- Establish relationships between epics and user stories
- Set up views for better visibility and management
- Implement automated workflows where possible

## ü§ñ Automated Migration Scripts

The following scripts were created to automate the GitHub Project migration process:

### 1. Project Creation

```bash
# scripts/create-github-project.sh
# Creates a new GitHub Project
gh projects create --user '@me' --title "AI Assistant Development" --format json
```

### 2. Issue Migration

```bash
# scripts/migrate-issues.sh
# Add all epics and user stories to the project
for ISSUE_URL in $(gh issue list --json url --jq '.[] | .url'); do
  gh projects item-add $PROJECT_NUM --user '@me' --url "$ISSUE_URL"
done
```

### 3. Custom Field Creation

```bash
# scripts/update-project-fields.sh
# Create and set Type, Priority, and Story Points fields
gh projects field-create $PROJECT_NUM --user '@me' --name "Type" --data-type "SINGLE_SELECT" --single-select-options "Epic,User Story,Task"
gh projects field-create $PROJECT_NUM --user '@me' --name "Priority" --data-type "SINGLE_SELECT" --single-select-options "High,Medium,Low"
gh projects field-create $PROJECT_NUM --user '@me' --name "Story Points" --data-type "NUMBER"
```

### 4. Epic Field Creation

```bash
# scripts/create-epic-field.sh
# Create Epic field with all epic titles as options for user stories
gh projects field-create $PROJECT_NUM --user '@me' --name "Epic" --data-type "SINGLE_SELECT" --single-select-options "$EPIC_TITLES"
```

### 5. Component Field

```bash
# scripts/create-component-field.sh
# Create Component field with component categories
gh projects field-create $PROJECT_NUM --user '@me' --name "Component" --data-type "SINGLE_SELECT" --single-select-options "Core Agents,MCP,Workflow,Shared Components,External Integration,Testing"
```

### 6. Parent Issue Relationships

```bash
# scripts/set-parent-issue.sh
# Attempts to set parent-child relationships programmatically
# Falls back to generating a guide for manual entry if API approach fails
# Usage: ./set-parent-issue.sh <child_issue_number> <parent_issue_number>
```

### 7. Comment Migration

```bash
# scripts/migrate-all-comments.sh
# Extract comments from all issues with proper formatting
# Creates Markdown files for each issue's comments for manual addition to item notes
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Migration Steps

Due to API limitations, some steps of the migration need to be done manually:

### Step 1: Create a new GitHub Project

1. Go to [https://github.com/users/o2alexanderfedin?tab=projects](https://github.com/users/o2alexanderfedin?tab=projects)
2. Click "New project"
3. Select "Team planning" as the template
4. Name it "AI Assistant Development"
5. Add description: "Project board for AI Assistant architecture and implementation"
6. Click "Create"

### Step 2: Set up custom fields

1. Click "+" icon next to the default fields to add new fields
2. Add the following custom fields:
   - **Type**: Single select field with options: Epic, User Story, Task
   - **Priority**: Single select field with options: High, Medium, Low
   - **Story Points**: Number field
   - **Component**: Single select field with options: Core Agents, MCP, Workflow, Shared Components, External Integration, Testing
   - **Epic Link**: Single select field (initially empty, we'll populate options later)

### Step 3: Add epics to the project

1. Click "+ Add item" at the bottom of the project board
2. Select "Add item from repository" 
3. For each epic (issues #1-7):
   - Add to the project board
   - Set the Type field to "Epic"
   - Set Priority based on labels (priority:high ‚Üí High, etc.)
   - Set Component based on labels (see mapping below)
   - Add the epic title to the Epic Link field options

### Step 4: Add user stories to the project

1. Click "+ Add item" again
2. For each user story (issues with user-story label):
   - Add to the project board
   - Set the Type field to "User Story"
   - Set the Epic Link field to the parent epic (check the "Epic: #X" reference in the user story description)
   - Set Story Points field based on points:X label
   - Set Priority based on labels
   - Set Component based on labels

### Step 5: Set Parent issue field values

Due to API limitations, Parent issue field values must be set manually:

1. Run the `set-parent-manual.sh` script to generate a list of parent-child relationships
2. Go to the GitHub Project in the web UI
3. For each user story:
   - Click on the issue to open its side panel
   - Find the "Parent issue" field
   - Type "#" and select the appropriate parent epic from the dropdown
   - Save the change and proceed to the next issue

See the [Parent Issue Guide](/docs/logs/2025-05-17/parent-issue-guide.md) for detailed instructions and the technical challenges encountered.

### Step 6: Create useful views

1. Create an "Epics Overview" view
   - Add filter: Type = Epic
   - Group by: Component
   - Show fields: Title, Priority, Story Points

2. Create a "User Stories by Epic" view
   - Add filter: Type = User Story
   - Group by: Epic Link
   - Show fields: Title, Priority, Story Points, Component

3. Create a "Stories by Component" view
   - Add filter: Type = User Story
   - Group by: Component
   - Show fields: Title, Priority, Story Points, Epic Link

## üîÅ Component Mapping

The following categories are used to classify issues by component:

- **Core Agents**: Issues related to agent types (developer, implementer, reviewer, tester, documentation, devops)
- **MCP**: Issues about communication protocols, MCP implementation
- **Workflow**: Issues related to orchestration, task workflows, task lifecycle
- **External Integration**: GitHub, CI/CD, development environment, external systems
- **Shared Components**: Registry, state store, task queue, knowledge base, metrics
- **Testing**: Test-related issues, TDD workflows, testing frameworks

## üîÑ Parent-Child Field Issues

The GitHub Project has two different ways to track parent-child relationships:

### 1. Custom Epic Field

- Single-select field with epic titles as options
- Used for logical grouping of user stories under epics
- Displayed in views for filtering and grouping

### 2. Built-in Parent Issue Field

- Native GitHub Projects field
- Links issues directly in the GitHub UI
- Shows parent-child relationships in the issue view
- **Must be set manually in the GitHub UI**
- API limitations prevent programmatic setting

Our investigation revealed that:

1. The GitHub GraphQL API does not support setting the built-in Parent issue field
   - Error: "InputObject 'ProjectV2FieldValue' doesn't accept argument 'projectV2Item'"
2. Setting parent issue fields must be done manually through the GitHub UI
3. This limitation affects all script-based automation approaches

## üìä Migration Data

Here's a summary of the data being migrated:

### Epics

| # | Title | Story Points | Priority | Component |
|---|-------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Core Agent System Implementation | 60 | High | Core Agents |
| 2 | Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation | 43 | High | MCP |
| 3 | Specialized Agent Implementation | 42 | Medium | Core Agents |
| 4 | Agent Task Workflow Implementation | 39 | Medium | Workflow |
| 5 | Shared Component Implementation | 57 | Medium | Shared Components |
| 6 | External Integration Implementation | 49 | Medium | External Integration |
| 7 | System Testing and Quality Assurance | 36 | Low | Testing |

### User Stories

The project contains approximately 50 user stories spread across these epics, each with assigned story points, priorities, and components.

### Parent-Child Relationships

Here's a sample of the parent-child relationships identified from issue bodies:

```
‚Ä¢ Issue #66: 'Secure Agent Creation' ‚Üí Epic #1: 'üîÑ Core Agent System Implementation'
‚Ä¢ Issue #65: 'Agent Template Management' ‚Üí Epic #1: 'üîÑ Core Agent System Implementation'
‚Ä¢ Issue #64: 'Agent Instance Creation' ‚Üí Epic #1: 'üîÑ Core Agent System Implementation'
‚Ä¢ Issue #58: 'Implement DevOps Agent' ‚Üí Epic #3: 'üß† Specialized Agent Implementation'
‚Ä¢ Issue #57: 'Implement Documentation Agent' ‚Üí Epic #3: 'üß† Specialized Agent Implementation'
‚Ä¢ Issue #53: 'Implement Shared Component Unit Tests' ‚Üí Epic #7: 'üîç System Testing and Quality Assurance'
‚Ä¢ Issue #52: 'Develop Core Agent Unit Tests' ‚Üí Epic #7: 'üîç System Testing and Quality Assurance'
```

## üß∞ Token Requirements

Ensure your GitHub token has the right scopes:

```bash
# Refresh token with project scope
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project

# Verify token has project scope
gh auth status
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Challenges

- GitHub API requires special token scope for Projects API access
- Token must be refreshed with: `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project`
- Project ID and item IDs are non-deterministic, requiring dynamic handling
- Comment migration requires manual steps due to GraphQL API limitations
- **Parent issue field cannot be set through the GitHub GraphQL API** - manual setting is required
