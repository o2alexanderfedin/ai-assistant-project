# Architecture Documentation Updates

*May 17, 2025*

## 📋 Summary

Today we updated the architecture documentation to ensure consistent terminology and improve clarity. The key focus was replacing "Analysis Pair" with "Decomposition Pair" throughout the documentation to better reflect its purpose in breaking down complex tasks into subtasks.

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. Terminology Updates
- Renamed "Analysis Pair" to "Decomposition Pair" throughout
- Renamed "Analysis-Reviewer" to "Decomposition-Reviewer"
- Renamed "Analysis-Implementer" to "Decomposition-Implementer"
- Updated all associated diagrams and descriptions

### 2. Documentation Improvements
- Removed redundant GitHub use case sections in the orchestrator-use-cases.md
- Updated the Multi-Agent Orchestration diagram to correctly show the Decomposition-Implementer
- Updated the Task Decomposition Flow diagram
- Fixed edge case descriptions to use consistent terminology

### 3. Content Structure
- Streamlined the use case documentation to focus on agent interactions
- Updated dates to reflect the latest changes

## 🔍 Key Insights

- The "Decomposition Pair" terminology better reflects the actual role of this agent pair in the system
- GitHub's role in the system is passive (as a data store) and doesn't need separate use case diagrams
- The documentation now clearly shows the Reviewer-Implementer pattern applied to different specializations

## 📝 Discussion Points

We discussed whether to keep the GitHub-specific use case sections and decided to remove them to keep the documentation more focused on the active components in the system. GitHub's role as a data store doesn't warrant separate use case diagrams as it largely serves as a passive repository for task information and code.
