## Initial Inquiry

After completing the 0.5.0 release process, we attempted to search through our documentation to find information about how epics were analyzed and groomed into user stories. This search was inefficient, requiring manual searching through numerous files.

The inefficiency of this search prompted a discussion about introducing better search capabilities to our documentation system:

> "I see that we're doing the search in a very inefficient way. I'd say it is type to introduce vector database and semantic search. Find out if simple RAG solution would be enough, or we need GraphRAG solution."

This triggered research into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) versus GraphRAG solutions for our documentation needs.

## Research and Analysis

The research focused on two main approaches:

1. **Simple RAG Solution**
   - Uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar content
   - Document chunks are converted to vectors and stored in a vector database
   - Searches use semantic similarity to find relevant information
   - Simpler to implement but limited in handling complex relationships

2. **GraphRAG Solution**
   - Combines knowledge graphs with vector search
   - Preserves relationships between entities in the documentation
   - Better for multi-hop reasoning and complex queries
   - More complex to implement and maintain

The research included:
- Comparative analysis of both approaches
- Technical implementation details
- Resource requirements
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Specific considerations for documentation search

Key findings suggested that while GraphRAG offers superior handling of complex relationships, a simple RAG solution would be sufficient for our current needs and could be implemented more quickly with fewer resources.

## Decision Evolution

Our approach evolved through several stages:

### Initial Recommendation

Initially, we decided to proceed with a Simple RAG solution with specific enhancements:
- Document-type specific chunking strategies
- Metadata preservation
- Two-stage retrieval for better relevance

### MCP Server Investigation

Further research into available tools led us to explore MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

> "Now, check if there are MCP servers available for both simple RAG and GraphRAG"

This investigation revealed several MCP server options:
- Chroma MCP Server for vector storage
- Pinecone MCP Server for vector storage
- Memory MCP Server for knowledge graph capabilities
- Neo4j and Graphiti for full GraphRAG implementation

### Discovery of Memory MCP Server

A key finding was the Memory MCP server, which provides knowledge graph capabilities in a lightweight implementation:

> "Check this one: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory"

Analysis of this server revealed:
- Entity-relation knowledge graph structure
- Persistent storage capabilities
- Simple integration with Claude
- Ability to represent relationships without complex graph database

### MCP Server Management Rule

To formalize our approach to MCP servers, we created a new rule:

> "Make a rule that we should fetch these as git submodules under .claude/mcp-servers/"

This rule established:
- Standard directory structure for MCP servers
- Git submodule management approach
- Documentation requirements
- Configuration patterns

## Final Approach

After thorough research and discussion, we decided on a hybrid approach:

1. **Vector-Based RAG + Knowledge Graph Memory**
   - Use vector database (Chroma) for semantic similarity search
   - Employ Memory MCP server for relationship representation
   - Integrate both approaches for comprehensive results

2. **MCP Server Integration**
   - Added Memory MCP server as a git submodule
   - Created documentation for integration and usage
   - Defined configuration patterns for Claude Desktop

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Phase 1: Core implementation of both systems
   - Phase 2: Knowledge population and integration
   - Phase 3: Refinement and optimization

This hybrid approach provides the benefits of both systems:
- Semantic search from vector database
- Relationship awareness from knowledge graph
- Gradual enrichment capability
- Lower implementation complexity than full GraphRAG

## Key Takeaways

1. Our current documentation search approach is inefficient and needs improvement

2. A hybrid approach combining vector search with knowledge graph memory offers the best balance of:
   - Implementation simplicity
   - Relationship awareness
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Resource efficiency

3. MCP servers provide ready-made integration points for Claude:
   - Memory MCP server for knowledge graph capabilities
   - Consistent management through git submodules
   - Standard configuration patterns

4. Document-type specific handling remains crucial:
   - Different chunking strategies for different document types
   - Specialized embedding approaches for code
   - Knowledge graph entities for key concepts

5. The hybrid approach allows for incremental improvement:
   - Begin with basic vector search and key relationships
   - Gradually enrich the knowledge graph
   - Add more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms over time
