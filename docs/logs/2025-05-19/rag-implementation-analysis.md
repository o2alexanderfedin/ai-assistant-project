## Problem Statement

The current approach to searching through our project documentation is inefficient, requiring manual searching through numerous files to find information about specific processes, relationships, and methodologies (such as epic-to-user-story grooming). This results in lengthy search times and potentially missed information.

## Options Analysis

### Simple RAG Solution

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar content:

**Advantages:**
- Faster implementation timeline
- Lower computational resource requirements
- Well-supported by frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Sufficient for moderate document relationships
- Good performance on semantic search for general queries

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited ability to handle complex relationships between documents
- May struggle with multi-hop reasoning questions
- Less effective for hierarchical structure navigation

**Technical Components:**
- Document processing pipeline
- Vector embedding generation
- Vector database (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Retrieval mechanism
- Generation component

### GraphRAG Solution

GraphRAG combines knowledge graphs with vector search to represent complex relationships:

**Advantages:**
- Superior handling of entity relationships
- Better for multi-hop reasoning queries
- Preserves hierarchical document structures
- Improved context awareness for complex queries
- Creates structured representations of information

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex implementation
- Higher computational and storage requirements
- Requires ongoing maintenance of the knowledge graph
- Potentially expensive for large document collections
- Overkill for simpler documentation structures

**Technical Components:**
- Knowledge graph construction
- Entity extraction and relationship mapping
- Graph database
- Vector embeddings for entities
- Hybrid retrieval mechanism (graph + vector)
- Generation component

### Hybrid Memory-Based Approach

After further research, we've identified a promising hybrid approach using the Memory MCP server:

**Advantages:**
- Combines knowledge graph structure with simple implementation
- Provides entity-relation model without complex graph database
- Persistent storage of relationships and observations
- Ready-made MCP server implementation
- Low overhead and resource requirements
- Can be gradually enriched over time

**Disadvantages:**
- Less scalable than dedicated graph databases
- Limited to entities explicitly added to the graph
- Requires manual knowledge graph construction
- Not optimized for high-volume querying

**Technical Components:**
- Memory MCP server
- Knowledge graph structure (entities, relations, observations)
- Integration with vector search
- Custom prompting strategy
- JSON-based persistent storage

## Technical Implementation Considerations

**Document Processing:**
- Different chunking strategies needed for:
  - Markdown documentation
  - Code snippets
  - Architectural diagrams
  - Process descriptions

**Code-Specific Handling:**
- Code requires specialized embedding approaches
- Structure preservation is critical

**Query Processing:**
- Natural language queries need to map to technical terminology
- Query expansion for bridging semantic gaps

**Integration Requirements:**
- Must integrate with existing documentation workflow
- Should support automated updates as documentation changes

**MCP Server Integration:**
- Memory MCP server provides knowledge graph capabilities
- Can be installed as git submodule in `.claude/mcp-servers/`
- Integrates with Claude Desktop through configuration

## Recommendation

Implement a **Hybrid Approach** using:

1. **Simple RAG with Vector Store:**
   - Document processing pipeline for text chunking
   - Vector database (initially Chroma) for semantic similarity
   - Basic retrieval mechanism for content search

2. **Memory MCP Knowledge Graph:**
   - Entity-relation model for key documentation concepts
   - Persistent storage of relationships
   - Gradual enrichment of knowledge graph

3. **Integration Layer:**
   - Combined query processing
   - Result fusion from both sources
   - Contextual response generation

This hybrid approach provides the benefits of structured relationships while maintaining implementation simplicity.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Implementation**
   - Document processing pipeline setup
   - Vector database integration
   - Memory MCP server deployment
   - Basic query interface

2. **Phase 2: Knowledge Population**
   - Extract core entities and relationships
   - Create initial knowledge graph
   - Develop enrichment strategy
   - Implement combined retrieval

3. **Phase 3: Integration & Refinement**
   - Documentation workflow integration
   - Automated updates for both systems
   - Performance optimization
   - User feedback collection

## Future Considerations

If the hybrid approach proves insufficient after implementation and testing, consider:

1. **Full GraphRAG:** Implement a complete GraphRAG solution with dedicated graph database if complex relationship queries become frequent and critical.

2. **Domain-Specific Embeddings:** Train custom embeddings on our technical documentation to improve semantic understanding.

3. **Advanced Retrieval Algorithms:** Implement more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms that combine multiple information sources.
