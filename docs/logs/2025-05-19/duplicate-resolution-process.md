# Duplicate User Stories Resolution Process

Date: 2025-05-19

## üìã Process Overview

This document outlines the manual process for resolving duplicate user stories in the GitHub Project, based on the semantic analysis in [duplicate-user-stories-analysis.md](./duplicate-user-stories-analysis.md).

## üîÑ Resolution Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment

1. Open two browser windows side by side:
   - Window 1: GitHub Project board view
   - Window 2: GitHub Issues view

2. Create a resolution tracking spreadsheet with the following columns:
   - Issue Pair (e.g., "#9 / #59")
   - Primary Issue (to keep)
   - Duplicate Issue (to remove)
   - Content Differences
   - Metadata Differences
   - Resolution Notes
   - Status (Pending/In Progress/Resolved)

### Step 2: Detailed Comparison Process

For each duplicate pair, perform a detailed side-by-side comparison:

#### 2.1 GitHub Task Monitoring (#9 vs #59)

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Document the unique elements in #59 (more detailed technical notes, documentation references)
   - Note the format differences between issues
   - Identify any missing acceptance criteria or implementation details

2. **Metadata Comparison**:
   - Note that #59 has "External Integration" component vs "Core Agents" in #9
   - Note that #59 has "Highest" priority vs "High" in #9
   - Document label differences (implementation label in #59)

3. **Resolution Decision**:
   - Keep #9 as the primary issue
   - Transfer additional details from #59's acceptance criteria
   - Consider adopting the more appropriate component assignment from #59
   - Maintain the higher priority level from #59

#### 2.2 Agent Lifecycle Management (#10 vs #60)

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Document any unique elements in #60
   - Identify improvements in acceptance criteria or technical notes

2. **Metadata Comparison**:
   - Verify both have "Core Agents" component
   - Verify both have "High" priority
   - Document any label differences

3. **Resolution Decision**:
   - Keep #10 as the primary issue
   - Transfer any improved or additional acceptance criteria from #60
   - Maintain consistent components and priority

#### 2.3-2.8 Remaining Duplicate Pairs

Follow the same process for each remaining pair:
- Task Analysis and Agent Matching (#12 vs #62)
- Task Classification and Prioritization (#13 vs #63)
- Agent Instance Creation (#14 vs #64)
- Agent Template Management (#15 vs #65)
- Secure Agent Creation (#16 vs #66)
- Orchestrator MCP Communication (#11 vs #61)

### Step 3: Primary Issue Enhancement

For each primary issue that needs enhancement:

1. Open the primary issue (lower number) for editing
2. Copy relevant unique content from the duplicate issue
3. Update the primary issue's description with the enhanced content
4. Adjust metadata (component, priority, labels) if appropriate
5. Add a note at the bottom: "Enhanced with content from duplicate issue #XX"
6. Save changes

### Step 4: Duplicate Removal

After enhancing each primary issue:

1. Open the GitHub Project board
2. Locate the duplicate issue (higher number)
3. Remove the duplicate from the project (do not close the underlying GitHub issue)
4. Update the resolution tracking spreadsheet with the status

### Step 5: Reference Management

1. Search the entire repository for references to the removed duplicates:
   - Search code files, documentation, and other issues
   - Look for explicit references like "#59" or "issue 59"

2. For each reference found:
   - Update the reference to point to the corresponding primary issue
   - Document the change in the tracking spreadsheet

### Step 6: Verification

1. Verify each primary issue is complete:
   - All unique content from the duplicate has been incorporated
   - All metadata has been appropriately updated
   - The issue appears correctly in the GitHub Project board

2. Verify each duplicate has been removed from the project

3. Verify all references have been updated to point to primary issues

## üìä Duplicate Resolution Table

| Duplicate Pair | Primary Issue | Duplicate Issue | Component Difference | Priority Difference | Action Items |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| GitHub Task Monitoring | #9 | #59 | Yes - Update to External Integration | Yes - Update to Highest | Transfer documentation references, update component and priority |
| Agent Lifecycle Management | #10 | #60 | No | No | Transfer any additional implementation details |
| Orchestrator MCP Communication | #11 | #61 | No | No | Transfer any additional technical notes |
| Task Analysis and Agent Matching | #12 | #62 | No | No | Transfer any additional acceptance criteria |
| Task Classification and Prioritization | #13 | #63 | No | Yes - Primary has higher | Maintain higher priority in #13 |
| Agent Instance Creation | #14 | #64 | No | No | Transfer any additional implementation details |
| Agent Template Management | #15 | #65 | No | No | Transfer any enhanced technical notes |
| Secure Agent Creation | #16 | #66 | No | Yes - Update to High | Add shutdown procedures from #66, update priority |

## üîÑ Ongoing Process

After completing the initial resolution:

1. Document the duplication pattern in the project wiki
2. Create guidelines to prevent future duplication
3. Consider adding duplicate detection to project automation
4. Schedule a regular review to check for new duplicates

## üìù Documentation Update

After resolving all duplicates:

1. Update project documentation to mention the duplicate resolution
2. Document the decision to keep lower-numbered issues
3. Update any process documentation to prevent future duplication
