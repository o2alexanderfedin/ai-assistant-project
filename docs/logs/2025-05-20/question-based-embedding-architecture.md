## Overview

Today, I created a comprehensive technical architecture document for the question-based embedding approach that was discussed on 2025-05-19. The architecture document defines the components, data flow, API specifications, and implementation plan for integrating this approach into our RAG implementation.

## Process

The architecture design process involved:

1. **Analysis of Requirements**
   - Reviewed the question-based embedding discussion document
   - Identified key requirements and benefits
   - Understood integration points with existing components

2. **Component Design**
   - Designed detailed components for the document processing pipeline
   - Designed components for the query processing pipeline
   - Created a knowledge integration layer to connect with Memory MCP

3. **Technical Specification**
   - Defined detailed APIs for key components
   - Created implementation plans with phased approach
   - Documented performance considerations and testing strategy

4. **Visualization**
   - Created comprehensive system architecture diagram
   - Documented data flows for indexing and querying

## Key Decisions

Several important architectural decisions were made:

1. **Question Generation Strategy**
   - Generate 3-5 diverse questions per content chunk
   - Include factual, relationship, purpose, and process questions
   - Apply filtering and evaluation to ensure quality

2. **Query Transformation Approach**
   - Transform non-question queries into question format
   - Generate multiple variations for ambiguous queries
   - Preserve original query intent while standardizing format

3. **Integration Strategy**
   - Complement rather than replace knowledge graph approach
   - Use the same embedding model for consistency
   - Combine vector search results with graph results

4. **Implementation Phasing**
   - Three-phase approach starting with core components
   - Integration with existing systems in phase 2
   - Performance optimization in phase 3

## Open Questions

Some questions remain to be resolved:

1. **Embedding Model Selection**
   - Which specific embedding model provides the best performance for question-based embedding?
   - Should we fine-tune the model on a dataset of questions?

2. **Question Quality Metrics**
   - How do we quantitatively measure the quality of generated questions?
   - What thresholds should be applied for filtering?

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - What caching strategies will be most effective?
   - How to balance quality vs. performance tradeoffs?

4. **Integration Timeline**
   - When should this be integrated with the main RAG implementation?
   - What dependencies need to be resolved first?

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Review**
   - Schedule review of the architecture with team members
   - Gather feedback on component design and implementation plan

2. **Prototype Development**
   - Create prototype of question generation component
   - Test with sample documentation to evaluate quality

3. **Integration Planning**
   - Define detailed integration timeline with existing components
   - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Add references to this architecture in the RAG implementation analysis
   - Update relevant component documentation to reference this approach

The architecture document is now available at: `/docs/architecture/components/question-based-embedding.md`
