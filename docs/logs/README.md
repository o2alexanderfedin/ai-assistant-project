## 📋 Overview

This directory contains logs of all discussions, decisions, and development activities related to the multi-agent system project. These logs provide a historical record of the project's evolution and serve as references for understanding architectural decisions and implementation details.

## 📂 Log Organization

The logs are organized by date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` with topic-specific files within each dated directory:

```

  │   ├── architecture-components.md
  │   ├── initial-discussion.md
  │   ├── requirements-definition.md
  │   ├── development-environment-implementation.md
  │   ├── system-diagrams-creation.md

## 🔄 Contributing Guidelines

When creating new log entries:

1. Create a new directory for the current date if one doesn't exist
2. Create a separate file for each distinct topic or discussion
3. Follow the standard log format
4. Include cross-references to relevant architecture documents
5. Update this README.md file to include links to new log entries
6. Use clear, descriptive filenames that indicate the topic
