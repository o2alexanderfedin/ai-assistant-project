## 📋 Overview

This directory contains logs of all discussions, decisions, and development activities related to the multi-agent system project. These logs provide a historical record of the project's evolution and serve as references for understanding architectural decisions and implementation details.

## 📂 Log Organization

The logs are organized by date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` with topic-specific files within each dated directory:

```
/docs/logs/
  ├── 2024-05-16/
  │   ├── architecture-components.md
  │   ├── initial-discussion.md
  │   └── requirements-definition.md
  ├── 2025-05-16/
  │   ├── development-environment-implementation.md
  │   └── system-diagrams-creation.md
  └── README.md
```

## 📝 Log Format

Each log file follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Clear description of the topic
2. **Date**: Date of the discussion or activity
3. **Participants**: Contributors involved in the discussion
