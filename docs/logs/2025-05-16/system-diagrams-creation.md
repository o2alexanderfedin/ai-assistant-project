## Context

As part of the architectural documentation effort, the team identified the need for standardized diagrams to visually represent the multi-agent system architecture. This log documents the discussion, decisions, and implementation of the system diagrams.

## Diagram Standards

The team discussed various diagram formats and standards and decided on the following approach:

1. **Text-based (ASCII/Unicode) Diagrams**:
   - Maximum compatibility with version control
   - Easy to maintain and update in-line with code
   - Viewable directly in terminal and text editors
   - Consistent rendering across platforms

2. **Diagram Conventions**:
   - Rectangle shapes for components and systems
   - Arrow symbols for data flow and relationships
   - Consistent direction (top-to-bottom and left-to-right)
   - Grid-aligned components for readability
   - Consistent symbols across all diagrams

3. **Documentation Integration**:
   - Diagrams stored in dedicated diagrams directory
   - Referenced from relevant documentation
   - Included in-line in markdown documents
   - Versioned alongside the code

## Diagram Types Created

The team created several types of diagrams to represent different aspects of the architecture:

1. **System Diagrams**:
   - High-level system architecture
   - Component relationships
   - Communication flows

2. **Component Diagrams**:
   - Internal structure of key components
   - Development Environment component
   - CI/CD Connector component

3. **Interface Diagrams**:
   - Key interfaces between components
   - Development Environment Interface
   - API structure diagrams

4. **Process Diagrams**:
   - Agent Task Workflow
   - Development Environment provisioning workflow
   - Task execution flow

## Diagram Tooling

For creating and maintaining the diagrams, the team evaluated several approaches:

1. **Manual Creation**:
   - Direct editing of ASCII/Unicode art
   - Requires careful alignment and formatting

2. **Text-based Diagramming Tools**:
   - Evaluated `asciiflow.com` and similar tools
   - Good for initial creation but requires manual export

3. **Programmatic Generation**:
   - Discussed potential for generating diagrams from code
   - Could be implemented in future for consistency

The team decided to primarily use manual creation with text-based diagramming tools as assistants, given the current project phase.

## Usage Guidelines

Guidelines for using and maintaining the diagrams:

1. **When to Create Diagrams**:
   - For new components or significant component updates
   - For new interfaces or significant interface changes
   - For complex processes or workflows
   - When visual representation enhances understanding

2. **Diagram Maintenance**:
   - Update diagrams when components or interfaces change
   - Ensure diagrams reflect current architecture
   - Review diagrams during architecture reviews
   - Keep diagram style consistent

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Focus on clarity over complexity
   - Limit diagram size to what's viewable in a standard terminal
   - Include explanatory text with each diagram
   - Link diagrams to relevant documentation

## Future Diagrams

The team identified several additional diagrams to create in the future:

1. **Data Flow Diagrams**:
   - Detailed representation of data flow between components
   - Security boundaries and trust zones

2. **Deployment Diagrams**:
   - Infrastructure and deployment topology
   - Scaling and high-availability patterns

3. **State Transition Diagrams**:
   - Agent lifecycle states
   - Task state transitions

4. **Sequence Diagrams**:
   - Detailed interaction sequences for complex operations
   - Error handling flows
