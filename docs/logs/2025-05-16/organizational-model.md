## üìã Overview

Today we refined the architecture to model an efficient human organization rather than relying on rigid workflow engines. This approach leverages Claude's reasoning capabilities through carefully crafted prompts, mimicking how human teams collaborate and make decisions. This shift creates a more flexible and adaptable system that can handle diverse task types while maintaining the specialization of individual agents.

## üîë Key Design Elements

1. **Human Organizational Structure**:
   - System models executives (Orchestrator), managers (Project Managers), and specialists
   - Clear reporting lines and responsibility domains
   - Team formation based on task requirements
   - Emergent leadership based on expertise relevance

2. **Reasoning-Based Coordination**:
   - Decisions made through reasoning rather than rigid rules
   - Prompt templates that encourage thoughtful consideration
   - Context-aware decision making
   - Rationale documentation for important decisions

3. **Git Hooks for Process Guidance**:
   - Context-providing hooks that guide without enforcing
   - Branch-specific guidance
   - Just-in-time information delivery
   - Lightweight process nudges

4. **Natural Workflows**:
   - Domain-specific reasoning patterns
   - Flexible checkpoints based on natural work boundaries
   - Asynchronous coordination through status updates
   - Ambient awareness of team activities

## üß† Reasoning vs. Workflow Engines

The key distinction in our approach is the use of reasoning over rigid workflows:

1. **Reasoning Approach Benefits**:
   - Adapts naturally to new situations without rule changes
   - Provides rationale along with decisions
   - Handles edge cases gracefully
   - Feels more natural in human interactions
   - Leverages Claude's core strengths

2. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Detailed prompt templates for different reasoning contexts
   - Shell functions that inject appropriate reasoning prompts
   - Simple coordination scripts instead of complex engines
   - Git hooks that provide contextual guidance
   - System profiles that emphasize reasoning over rule-following

3. **Example Implementations**:
   - Reasoning prompts for domain-specific approaches (TDD, creative work, research)
   - Context-providing Git hooks that suggest next steps
   - Lightweight shell scripts for coordination
   - Simple status update mechanisms

## üìù Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been created or updated:

1. **Organizational Model**:
   - Created `/docs/architecture/organizational-model.md`
   - Detailed the human organizational approach
   - Provided examples of prompts and scripts
   - Contrasted reasoning vs. workflow approaches

2. **System Overview Updates**:
   - Updated high-level architecture to reflect organizational model
   - Replaced workflow engine with reasoning-based approaches
   - Added example reasoning prompts for different domains
   - Emphasized natural team dynamics

3. **Requirements Updates**:
   - Added organizational model section to requirements
   - Specified preference for reasoning over workflows
   - Emphasized lightweight process guidance

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

For the next phase, we should focus on:

1. Creating detailed prompt templates for different agent roles and tasks
2. Implementing Git hooks that provide contextual guidance
3. Developing shell functions for reasoning injection
4. Creating example agent system profiles
5. Prototyping simple coordination scripts
