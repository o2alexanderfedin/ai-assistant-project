## 📋 Overview

Today we made significant updates to the architecture documentation to incorporate additional requirements, enhance visual representation through diagrams, and expand the scope of the system beyond software development to support a wide range of task domains.

## 🔑 Key Updates

1. **Requirements Enhancement**:
   - Updated requirements document to include agent lifecycle management
   - Added requirements for tenant cost tracking
   - Incorporated design principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY)
   - Added requirement for GitHub CLI usage

2. **System Overview Updates**:
   - Expanded system scope to support diverse task domains
   - Added additional core agent types for non-development tasks
   - Enhanced GitHub integration details with CLI usage
   - Added domain-specific workflows beyond TDD
   - Updated scalability considerations with multi-tenant focus

3. **Process Documentation**:
   - Added Git workflow rules to CLAUDE.md
   - Specified completion requirements to ensure tasks are finished
   - Enhanced implementation rules with shell-script focus
   - Added requirement for continuous execution

4. **Architecture Diagrams**:
   - Created high-level system architecture diagram
   - Added component relationship diagram
   - Created agent lifecycle workflow diagram
   - Added task processing flow diagram
   - Created tenant cost tracking flow diagram

## 📊 Visual Documentation

The addition of visual diagrams significantly enhances the architecture documentation:

1. **System Architecture Diagram**: Visualizes the layered components of the system, from infrastructure to tenant management.

2. **Component Relationships**: Illustrates how different components interact with each other, showing dependencies and communication patterns.

3. **Agent Lifecycle Workflow**: Maps the complete lifecycle from task detection to agent termination, including the states and transitions.

4. **Task Processing Flow**: Shows how tasks move through the system from creation to completion, integrating with GitHub and Kanban boards.

5. **Tenant Cost Tracking Flow**: Visualizes the process of collecting, storing, and reporting cost data across the system.

## 📝 Additional Requirements

Several new requirements were incorporated into the architecture:

1. **Domain-Agnostic Tasks**: System now supports tasks of any type and complexity beyond just software development.

2. **GitHub CLI Integration**: Task management now explicitly uses GitHub CLI (gh) commands for all GitHub interactions.

3. **Multi-Tenant Cost Tracking**: Enhanced support for tracking costs across multiple tenants with reporting and alerting.

4. **Agent On-Demand Lifecycle**: Refined the agent lifecycle to support on-demand spawning and termination.

5. **Gitflow Workflow**: Added detailed Git workflow rules for the development process.

## ⏭️ Next Steps

For the next phase, we should focus on:

1. Setting up the GitHub repository with Gitflow branching model
2. Creating Git hook scripts for workflow guidance
3. Implementing the shell-based agent infrastructure
4. Defining a detailed tagging taxonomy for domain-specific tasks
5. Creating domain-specific agent templates
