## 📋 Overview

Today we developed a comprehensive architecture for tracking costs in our multi-tenant agent system. Since each Claude Code instance represents a cost and multiple tenants will be using the system, accurate cost tracking is essential for billing, resource allocation, and optimization decisions. The architecture leverages shell scripts and follows the same philosophy as our agent implementation, minimizing external dependencies.

## 🔑 Key Design Elements

1. **Tenant-Based Cost Attribution**:
   - Each agent instance is associated with a specific tenant
   - All costs are attributed to the correct tenant
   - Costs are tracked at multiple levels (agent, task, overall)
   - Clear separation between tenant data

2. **Comprehensive Data Collection**:
   - Agent lifecycle events (spawn, terminate)
   - Runtime metrics (token usage, API duration)
   - Task attribution data (task type, category, tenant)
   - GitHub integration for task cost tracking

3. **Storage and Analysis**:
   - Structured log files for primary storage
   - SQLite database for queryable analysis
   - Clear schema design with appropriate indexes
   - Shell-based database interface

4. **Reporting System**:
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly tenant reports
   - Cost trend analysis and visualization
   - Cost breakdown by agent type and task
   - Multiple output formats (text, CSV, JSON, HTML)

5. **Cost Control Mechanisms**:
   - Threshold monitoring for tenant costs
   - Alert system for threshold breaches
   - Usage forecasting and recommendations
   - Detailed attribution for cost optimization

## 🧠 Implementation Strategy

The tenant cost tracking system is implemented using a three-phase approach:

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Database schema creation
   - Directory structure setup
   - Configuration definition (tenant details, thresholds)

2. **Integration Phase**:
   - Agent lifecycle script integration
   - Task management cost attribution
   - MCP server usage tracking
   - Cost event logging

3. **Reporting Phase**:
   - Report generation scripts
   - Alert system implementation
   - Dashboard creation
   - Data analysis tools

All components are implemented using shell scripts, maintaining consistency with our overall architecture approach and minimizing dependencies.

## 📝 Documentation Progress

The following documentation has been created:

1. **Tenant Cost Tracking**:
   - Created `/docs/architecture/tenant-cost-tracking.md`
   - Detailed the overall architecture
   - Documented data collection approaches
   - Specified storage strategy
   - Outlined reporting system
   - Provided implementation details

2. **Example Scripts**:
   - Event logging scripts
   - Database interface
   - Report generation
   - Cost alert monitoring
   - Dashboard generation

These components provide a solid foundation for implementing accurate cost tracking in the multi-tenant agent system.

## ⏭️ Next Steps

For the next session, we plan to:

1. Define integration points with the agent lifecycle management system
2. Create detailed implementation examples for specific cost calculation scenarios
3. Document billing integration approach
4. Create operational procedures for cost monitoring
5. Define testing strategy for cost tracking accuracy
