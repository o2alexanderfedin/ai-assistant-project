## 📋 Overview

Today we focused on documenting the core processes that define how agents work within our multi-agent system. These processes ensure that tasks are matched to appropriate agents, executed consistently, and that new agents can be created when needed. Importantly, all processes are designed to be carefully matched to agent capabilities and roles.

## 🔑 Key Processes Documented

We documented four critical processes:

1. **Task Execution Process**: Defines how agents approach and execute assigned tasks, with phases including:
   - Task Analysis & Planning
   - Test Creation (following TDD)
   - Implementation
   - Review & Refinement
   - Integration & Verification
   
   The process is customizable based on agent type, task requirements, and domain specifics.

2. **Agent-Task Matching Algorithm**: Defines how tasks are paired with the most suitable agent, considering:
   - Multiple task dimensions (technical domain, functional area, complexity)
   - Agent dimensions (expertise, focus, workload)
   - Process dimensions (methodology fit, agent familiarity)
   - Scoring model for optimal matching

3. **TDD Workflow**: Specifies how Test-Driven Development is implemented across all agent types, including:
   - Core TDD cycle (test, fail, implement, pass, refactor)
   - Domain-specific adaptations
   - Agent role adaptations
   - Verification mechanisms
   - Quality metrics

4. **Agent Creation Process**: Defines how new specialized agents are created when needed, with steps including:
   - Need determination
   - Agent specification
   - System prompt engineering
   - Claude Code instance configuration
   - Validation and deployment

## 🧩 Process-Agent Alignment

A key theme across all documentation is the alignment between processes and agents:

1. **Process Customization**: Processes are customized based on agent specializations and capabilities
2. **Agent-Specific Workflows**: Each agent type follows adaptations of the core processes
3. **Process Selection**: The most appropriate process is selected for each agent-task pairing
4. **Process Evolution**: Processes evolve based on agent performance and feedback
5. **Validation**: Agents are validated against process requirements

This alignment ensures that each agent operates according to processes that match their role and capabilities, maximizing effectiveness and quality.

## 📝 Documentation Progress

Documentation created today:

1. **Process Documentation**:
   - `/docs/architecture/components/task-execution-process.md`
   - `/docs/architecture/components/agent-task-matching.md`
   - `/docs/architecture/components/tdd-workflow.md`
   - `/docs/architecture/components/agent-creation-process.md`

2. **Updated Documentation**:
   - `/docs/architecture/components/README.md` - Updated to include process components

## ⏭️ Next Steps

For the next session, we plan to:

1. Document specific agent types (Developer, Tester, Reviewer, etc.)
2. Create sequence diagrams for key workflows
3. Document error handling and recovery processes
4. Define metrics and monitoring for process evaluation
5. Specify infrastructure requirements for the system
