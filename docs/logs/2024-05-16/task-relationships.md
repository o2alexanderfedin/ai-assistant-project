## 📋 Overview

Today we enhanced the architecture to incorporate comprehensive task relationship requirements. GitHub issues will now maintain clear relationships with parent tasks, subtasks, related documentation, process guidelines, and associated projects. This creates a navigable task graph that provides context and connections between work items, making it easier for agents to understand the broader context of their work.

## 🔑 Key Task Relationship Requirements

The following key requirements were added:

1. **Documentation Linking**:
   - Tasks must include links to relevant documentation
   - Documentation references should provide context for task execution
   - Links should be structured and categorized in the issue body

2. **Process Guidelines**:
   - Tasks must reference applicable process guidelines
   - Process links provide agents with workflow instructions
   - Guidelines ensure consistent methodology across similar tasks

3. **Task Hierarchy**:
   - Parent-child relationships must be maintained
   - Tasks created in relation to other tasks must link to their parent tasks
   - Decomposed tasks must reference all created subtasks
   - Relationship directionality must be preserved (parent ↔ child)

4. **Task Dependencies**:
   - Blocking/blocked-by relationships must be documented
   - Prerequisite tasks must be linked
   - Related tasks must be cross-referenced

5. **Project Association**:
   - Tasks must reference their associated project (where applicable)
   - Project context helps situate the task in the broader work scope

## 📊 GitHub Implementation Approach

The implementation uses GitHub CLI to maintain these relationships:

1. **Task Creation with Relationships**:
   - Parent references included at creation time
   - Documentation and process links specified in initial body
   - Project associations established via labels and body references

2. **Relationship Maintenance**:
   - When creating subtasks, parent tasks are automatically updated
   - When linking documentation, standardized sections are used
   - Bidirectional references maintained through automated scripts

3. **GitHub CLI Patterns**:
   - Standardized command patterns for relationship management
   - Template-based approach for consistent issue structure
   - Section-aware updates to maintain formatting

4. **Visualization**:
   - GitHub's native relationship visualization
   - Custom queries for relationship exploration
   - Standardized formatting for relationship sections

## 📝 Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been created or updated:

1. **Requirements**:
   - Added task relationship requirements to the requirements document
   - Specified linking needs for documentation, processes, and related tasks
   - Defined hierarchy and reference requirements

2. **System Overview**:
   - Enhanced GitHub integration section with relationship details
   - Added examples of GitHub CLI commands for relationship management
   - Specified section structure for task bodies

3. **Task Relationship Model**:
   - Created visual diagram of task relationships
   - Defined standard task content structure
   - Provided examples of relationship maintenance scripts

## ⏭️ Next Steps

For further improvements to task relationships, we should focus on:

1. Creating GitHub issue templates for different task types
2. Developing helper scripts for relationship management
3. Implementing validation to ensure relationships are maintained
4. Creating visualization tools for task graphs
5. Developing guidelines for task decomposition and reference management
