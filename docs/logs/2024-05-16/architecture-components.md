## üìã Core Components Defined

Today we defined the core components of the multi-agent system:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: The central coordination component that manages task distribution and workflow. Key responsibilities include:
   - Task intake from GitHub
   - Task analysis coordination
   - Agent assignment
   - Workflow management
   - System monitoring

2. **Analyzer Agent**: Responsible for analyzing tasks and matching them to appropriate agents. Key responsibilities include:
   - Task analysis
   - Capability matching
   - Agent load assessment
   - New agent recommendation

3. **Agent Factory**: Creates new specialized Claude Code agents when needed. Key responsibilities include:
   - Agent creation
   - Profile generation
   - Configuration management
   - Agent lifecycle management

We also defined the organizational structure for component documentation, including core agent components, orchestration components, development agent components, persistence components, and external integration components.

## üîå Interface Specifications

We defined key interface specifications:

1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The primary communication mechanism between agents, with each agent acting as both a server and client. The protocol defines:
   - Message format
   - Communication patterns
   - Debug mode requirements
   - Server/client configuration

2. **GitHub Integration Interface**: Provides a standardized way for agents to interact with GitHub for task management. The interface covers:
   - Issue management
   - Pull request workflow
   - Issue analytics
   - Authentication
   - Webhooks

These interfaces provide the foundation for agent communication and task management.

## üß† Architecture Decisions

We documented key architecture decisions:

1. **ADR-001: Agent Communication Protocol**: Decision to use MCP as the primary communication mechanism, with considerations of:
   - Alternatives (file-based, queue-based, direct API, shared database)
   - Pros (native integration, bidirectional, debugging support)
   - Cons (performance overhead, connection management)
   - Implementation strategy

2. **ADR-002: GitHub Integration Strategy**: Decision to implement a centralized GitHub integration service, with considerations of:
   - Alternatives (direct access, CLI operations, third-party services)
   - Pros (centralized authentication, rate limit management)
   - Cons (single point of failure, implementation complexity)
   - Implementation strategy

These decisions provide clear direction for implementation and document the rationale behind architectural choices.

## üìù Documentation Progress

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

For the next session, we plan to:

1. Define the TDD workflow implementation in detail
2. Document the developer agent components
3. Create interface specifications for the TDD workflow
4. Document the agent specialization strategy
5. Begin defining the implementation plan
