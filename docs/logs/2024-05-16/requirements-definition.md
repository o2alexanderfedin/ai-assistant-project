## 🔑 Key Requirements

The following key requirements have been defined for the multi-agent system:

1. **Agent Infrastructure**: All agents will be Claude Code instances running as both MCP servers and clients with maximum debug verbosity enabled (`--verbose --debug --mcp-debug`).

2. **Agent Personas**: Each agent will be assigned a specific role/persona using the system profile CLI option.

3. **Task Analysis**: The system must analyze incoming tasks and match them with corresponding agents for execution.

4. **Dynamic Agent Creation**: If no existing agent is a good match for a task, the system should create a new agent profile with an appropriate role/persona.

5. **GitHub Integration**: Tasks will be managed as GitHub issues with applicable tags.

6. **Autonomous Operation**: Agents should be able to create, update, comment on, and tag GitHub issues independently.

7. **Test-Driven Development**: All work on all types of tasks should follow a TDD process or appropriate adaptation.

## 💡 Architecture Implications

These requirements have significant architectural implications:

1. **MCP-Based Architecture**: The core communication will use the Model Context Protocol, requiring both server and client capabilities in each agent.

2. **Agent Specialization**: The system will need a way to define, store, and match agent capabilities to task requirements.

3. **Task Routing System**: A sophisticated analysis and routing component is required to distribute tasks effectively.

4. **Agent Factory**: The ability to create new specialized agents requires an agent template system and automated provisioning.

5. **GitHub API Integration**: Deep integration with GitHub APIs is needed for issue management.

6. **TDD Workflow Engine**: The system needs to enforce TDD practices across all agents and task types.

## 🧠 Design Decisions

Based on the requirements, the following design decisions have been made:

1. **Core Agent Types**: Define a set of specialized agent types including Orchestrator, Analyzer, Developer, Reviewer, Tester, Documentation, and DevOps agents.

2. **Hierarchical Control**: Implement an Orchestrator agent that manages task distribution and coordinates other agents.

3. **Task Analysis Engine**: Create a dedicated component to analyze new tasks and recommend agent assignments.

4. **GitHub-Centric Workflow**: Use GitHub issues as the primary mechanism for task definition, tracking, and completion.

5. **TDD Enforcement**: Implement checkpoints in the development process to ensure tests are written before implementation.

## 📝 Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been updated to reflect these requirements:

1. Created `/docs/architecture/requirements.md` to document system requirements
2. Updated `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md` with detailed architectural components
3. Defined core agent types and their responsibilities
4. Outlined the communication model between agents
5. Described the task management workflow and GitHub integration
6. Specified the TDD-based development workflow
7. Added scalability considerations to the architecture
