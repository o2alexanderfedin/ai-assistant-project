## 📋 Overview

Today we developed the architecture for managing agent lifecycles using an on-demand spawning approach combined with Kanban-style task processing. This approach allows our system to efficiently use resources by creating agent instances only when needed, having them pull and process tasks from a Kanban board implemented via GitHub issues, and gracefully terminating when their tasks are complete or reassigned.

## 🔑 Key Architecture Decisions

1. **On-Demand Agent Spawning**: Agents are created only when needed
   - Shell script-based agent creation and management
   - Agents spawned with specific templates based on required type
   - MCP servers configured and started with the agent process
   - Resource optimization through targeted instantiation

2. **Kanban Task Management**: Tasks flow through a well-defined board
   - GitHub issues used as Kanban board items
   - Status labels track task progression
   - Agents pull tasks rather than having them pushed
   - Clear visualization of work in progress

3. **Well-Defined Lifecycle States**: Agents follow a state machine
   - Initializing → Ready → Task Acquisition → Processing → Completion/Reassignment → Termination
   - Each state has specific responsibilities and handlers
   - Clean transitions between states

4. **Task Reassignment Capability**: Agents can redirect tasks when needed
   - Clear documentation of reassignment reasons
   - Ability to create new tasks or update existing ones
   - Linking between related tasks
   - Support for questions and decision requests

5. **MCP Server Management**: Careful handling of MCP servers
   - Server registry for tracking active instances
   - Heartbeat mechanism for health monitoring
   - Graceful termination process
   - Resource cleanup and archiving

## 🚀 On-Demand Agent Lifecycle

The agent lifecycle follows these key phases:

1. **Spawn Phase**:
   - System detects need for a specific agent type
   - Agent template is loaded and configured
   - Unique agent instance is created
   - Claude Code is started with MCP server capabilities
   - Agent registers with the orchestrator

2. **Task Acquisition Phase**:
   - Agent queries GitHub for tasks matching its capabilities
   - Agent selects a task based on priority
   - Agent updates task status to "In Progress"
   - Agent begins processing the task

3. **Processing Phase**:
   - Agent executes task using appropriate process
   - Regular progress updates are posted
   - Agent determines if it can complete the task

4. **Completion/Reassignment Phase**:
   - For completion: Agent updates task with results and marks as complete
   - For reassignment: Agent documents reason and redirects to appropriate agent type
   - Task status is updated accordingly

5. **Termination Phase**:
   - Agent unregisters from orchestrator
   - MCP server is gracefully shut down
   - Logs are archived for future reference
   - Resources are cleaned up

This approach optimizes resource usage by only running agents when they have work to do, while maintaining the flexibility to handle various task types.

## 📊 Kanban Task Processing

The Kanban board implemented via GitHub has these key features:

1. **Column Structure**:
   - **To Do**: Issues ready to be worked on (`status:to-do`)
   - **In Progress**: Issues currently being worked on (`status:in-progress`)
   - **Review**: Issues awaiting review (`status:review`)
   - **Done**: Completed issues (`status:done`)
   - **Blocked**: Issues that cannot proceed (`status:blocked`)

2. **Task Pulling Mechanism**:
   - Agents autonomously pull tasks rather than having them assigned
   - Task selection based on agent capabilities and task priority
   - Self-assignment to indicate ownership

3. **Task Reassignment**:
   - Agent can reassign a task if it determines it's not capable
   - Reassignment includes clear documentation of reasons
   - Option to create new tasks or update existing ones
   - Tasks can be blocked pending decisions or information

4. **Task Communication**:
   - GitHub issue comments for progress updates
   - Question raising through issue comments
   - Cross-linking of related issues
   - Clear status tracking through labels

This Kanban approach provides visibility, flexibility, and a clean workflow for managing tasks across diverse agent types.

## 📝 Documentation Progress

The following documentation has been created:

1. **Agent Lifecycle Management**:
   - Created `/docs/architecture/components/agent-lifecycle.md`
   - Detailed the on-demand spawning process
   - Documented Kanban task processing
   - Specified lifecycle states and handlers
   - Outlined task reassignment process
   - Documented MCP server management

2. **Updated Component Index**:
   - Added the Agent Lifecycle Management component to the index

## ⏭️ Next Steps

For the next session, we plan to:

1. Integrate the lifecycle management with the shell-based implementation approach
2. Define error handling and recovery mechanisms in more detail
3. Document the specific communication patterns between agents
4. Create sequence diagrams for key workflows
5. Document operational procedures for the system
