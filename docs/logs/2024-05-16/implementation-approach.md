## 📋 Overview

Today we updated the architecture to use a shell script-based implementation approach instead of Python. This decision simplifies the system, reduces dependencies, and provides a more lightweight solution for orchestrating Claude Code agents. The shell-based approach leverages standard Unix tools and focuses on configuration-driven behavior rather than complex code.

## 🔑 Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Shell Scripts as Primary Implementation**: We will use bash shell scripts as the primary implementation mechanism, avoiding Python dependencies:
   - Agent lifecycle management scripts (create, start, stop)
   - Orchestration and coordination logic
   - Task distribution and monitoring
   - Integration with external systems

2. **JSON for Configuration and Data**: Using JSON for structured data:
   - Agent configuration files
   - Process definitions
   - MCP message formatting
   - Task descriptions

3. **Standard Unix Tools**: Leveraging existing tools:
   - `jq` for JSON processing
   - `curl` for API interactions
   - `netcat/socat` for network communication
   - Standard Unix utilities for file and process management

4. **Minimal Dependencies**: The implementation minimizes external dependencies:
   - No Python runtime required
   - No additional language runtimes
   - No complex build systems
   - Just standard shell and Unix utilities

## 🧩 Shell Implementation Components

The implementation includes these key components:

1. **Agent Management Scripts**:
   - `create-agent.sh`: Creates new agent configurations
   - `start-agent.sh`: Starts Claude Code instances with appropriate parameters
   - `stop-agent.sh`: Gracefully shuts down agents

2. **Core System Components**:
   - `orchestrator.sh`: Main coordination service
   - `analyzer.sh`: Task analysis logic
   - Various utility scripts for common operations

3. **API Integration Scripts**:
   - `github.sh`: GitHub API integration utilities
   - `mcp.sh`: MCP protocol implementation
   - Simple wrappers for consistent API interaction

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - JSON configuration files
   - Directory-based configuration inheritance
   - Environment variable substitution

5. **Testing Scripts**:
   - Agent capability testing
   - MCP communication testing
   - Simple test harness

## 📝 Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been created or updated:

1. **Implementation Approach Document**:
   - Created `/docs/architecture/implementation-approach.md`
   - Detailed shell-based implementation approach
   - Included example scripts for key components
   - Defined configuration structures

2. **Updated Architecture README**:
   - Added implementation approach to navigation
   - Updated recent updates section
   - Added to key documents section

## ⏭️ Next Steps

For the next session, we plan to:

1. Create more detailed implementation examples for specific components
2. Define testing strategy for shell-based implementation
3. Create deployment and scaling documentation
4. Document operational procedures for the shell-based system
5. Develop monitoring and logging strategy
