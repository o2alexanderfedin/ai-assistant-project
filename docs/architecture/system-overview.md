## 📋 Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of our multi-agent system architecture. It outlines the core components, communication patterns, and design principles that guide the implementation of a network of Claude Code instances that collaborate on tasks of various types and domains using GitHub for task management. The system is designed to handle a wide range of tasks including, but not limited to, software development, content creation, research, analysis, and more.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The system consists of multiple Claude Code instances operating as both MCP servers and clients, each with a specific role and persona. These agents interact with each other and with GitHub to manage, distribute, and complete tasks across various domains. The architecture models an efficient human organization rather than implementing complex workflow engines.

Key architectural components include:

1. **Agent Infrastructure**: Claude Code instances with maximum debug verbosity
2. **Organizational Structure**: Mimics human teams with executives, managers, and specialists
3. **Reasoning-Based Coordination**: Uses Claude's reasoning capabilities instead of rigid workflows
4. **Task Analysis & Assignment**: Analyzes tasks and matches them to appropriate specialists
5. **Agent Factory**: Creates new specialized agents when needed
6. **GitHub Integration**: Interfaces with GitHub issues for task management using GitHub CLI
7. **Prompt-Based Processes**: Implements methodologies through reasoning prompts
8. **Natural Team Dynamics**: Allows for emergent leadership and natural collaboration
9. **Tenant Management**: Tracks costs and resources across multiple tenants

## 🤖 Core Agent Types

The system includes several specialized agent types:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages task distribution and inter-agent coordination
2. **Analyzer Agent**: Analyzes incoming tasks for routing decisions
3. **Developer Agents**: Implement software solutions following TDD methodology
4. **Reviewer Agents**: Review content and provide feedback
5. **Tester Agents**: Focus on test creation and validation
6. **Documentation Agents**: Create and maintain documentation
7. **DevOps Agents**: Handle deployment and infrastructure concerns
8. **Creative Agents**: Generate creative content (writing, art prompts, etc.)
9. **Research Agents**: Conduct research and synthesize information
10. **Analysis Agents**: Perform data analysis and interpretation

The system is designed to support diverse agent specializations across multiple domains. Additional specialized agents will be created dynamically as needed for specific task types across any knowledge domain.

## 🔀 Communication Model

Agents communicate via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), acting as both servers and clients. The communication follows a structured pattern:

1. Task requests are received by the Orchestrator
2. The Orchestrator delegates to the Analyzer
3. The Analyzer recommends an agent assignment
4. The Orchestrator assigns the task to the appropriate agent
5. Agents can request assistance from other agents
6. All communication is logged for debugging and improvement

## 📊 Task Management

Tasks are managed as GitHub issues using the GitHub CLI (gh) with the following workflow:

1. Issues are created either externally or by agents using `gh issue create`
2. The Orchestrator monitors the issue tracker for new and updated issues using `gh issue list`
3. Issues are analyzed by the Analyzer and assigned to appropriate agents
4. Agents pull available tasks using a Kanban approach
5. Agents update issues with progress, questions, and results using `gh issue comment`
6. Task completion is verified before issues are closed using `gh issue close`
7. Tasks can span any domain, from software development to creative writing to research

## 🧩 GitHub Integration

The system integrates deeply with GitHub using the GitHub CLI (gh):

1. Issues serve as the primary task management mechanism
2. Issue tags are used for categorization, priority setting, and domain identification
3. Agents create, update, comment on, and tag issues using the gh CLI
4. Pull requests are created and reviewed by agents when appropriate for the task domain
5. Issue linking maintains comprehensive relationships between tasks:
   ```bash
   # Example of linking parent and child tasks
   gh issue create --title "Implement user authentication system" --body "..." --label "feature,backend"
   gh issue create --title "Implement password hashing" --body "Part of #123 authentication system" --label "subtask,backend"
   gh issue edit 124 --body "$(gh issue view 124 --json body -q .body)

   ### Parent Task
   - #123: Implement user authentication system"
   
   # Example of linking related documentation
   gh issue edit 124 --body "$(gh issue view 124 --json body -q .body)
   
   ### Documentation
   - [Password Security Best Practices](docs/security/password-handling.md)
   - [Authentication System Architecture](docs/architecture/auth-system.md)"
   ```
6. Tasks include links to documentation and process guidelines
7. Task hierarchies are maintained through parent-child relationships
8. Tasks reference their projects and related work items
9. GitHub Projects are used for Kanban board visualization
10. GitHub Actions can be triggered by agent activity to automate workflows

## 🔄 Reasoning-Based Workflows

Instead of rigid workflow engines, the system uses reasoning-based approaches modeled after human work patterns:

### Development Process

Software development tasks use reasoning prompts for TDD guidance:

```bash
# Example reasoning prompt for TDD
function tdd_reasoning() {
  cat << EOF
You are approaching a development task using Test-Driven Development.

Task: $1

Think through this process:
1. What test cases would verify this functionality works correctly?
2. What edge cases should be considered?
3. How would you structure the minimum implementation to pass these tests?
4. What refactoring opportunities might emerge after initial implementation?

Write your test cases first, then reason through the implementation approach.
EOF
}
```

### Creative Process

Creative tasks use natural creative reasoning:

```bash
# Example reasoning prompt for creative work
function creative_reasoning() {
  cat << EOF
You are approaching a creative task that requires original thinking.

Task: $1

Consider your process:
1. What inspiration sources or references would be valuable?
2. What core concepts or themes should be explored?
3. How would you structure an initial draft or prototype?
4. What criteria would you use to evaluate and refine your work?

Describe your creative approach and how you'd develop and refine your work.
EOF
}
```

### Research Process

Research uses guided analytical thinking:

```bash
# Example reasoning prompt for research
function research_reasoning() {
  cat << EOF
You are approaching a research task that requires thorough investigation.

Task: $1

Plan your approach:
1. How would you define the scope and research questions?
2. What information sources would be most valuable?
3. How would you evaluate the reliability of different sources?
4. What method would you use to synthesize findings?
5. How would you structure conclusions and recommendations?

Outline your research methodology and how you'll ensure comprehensive coverage.
EOF
}
```

These prompts guide reasoning rather than enforcing rigid steps, allowing agents to think like skilled humans approaching tasks in their domain of expertise.

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

The architecture addresses scalability through:

1. Dynamic agent creation based on workload and domain requirements
2. Stateless communication between agents
3. Parallel task processing across multiple agents
4. Efficient resource allocation based on task priority and tenant quotas
5. Load balancing across available Claude Code instances
6. On-demand spawning and termination to optimize resource usage
7. Multi-tenant support with isolated resource tracking
8. Cost monitoring and threshold enforcement per tenant
