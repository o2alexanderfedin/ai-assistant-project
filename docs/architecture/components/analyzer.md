## 📋 Overview

The Analyzer Agent is responsible for analyzing incoming tasks, determining their requirements, and recommending the most appropriate agent to handle them. It serves as the intelligence behind task distribution, ensuring each task is matched with an agent that has the right skills and capacity.

## 🔑 Responsibilities

The Analyzer Agent is responsible for:

1. **Task Analysis**: Parsing task descriptions to identify requirements and characteristics
2. **Capability Matching**: Matching task requirements with agent capabilities
3. **New Agent Recommendation**: Recommending creation of new agents when no existing agent is suitable
4. **Task Classification**: Categorizing tasks by type, complexity, and priority
5. **Agent Load Assessment**: Considering current agent workloads in recommendations
6. **Analysis Explanation**: Providing rationale for agent selection decisions

## 🧩 Component Architecture

The Analyzer Agent consists of several subcomponents:

1. **Task Parser**: Extracts key information from task descriptions
2. **Classification Engine**: Categorizes tasks based on multiple dimensions
3. **Agent Capability Database**: Maintains a model of each agent's capabilities
4. **Matching Algorithm**: Scores potential agent-task matches
5. **Agent Specification Generator**: Creates specifications for new agent creation
6. **Explanation Generator**: Produces human-readable explanations for decisions

## 🔄 Core Workflows

### Task Analysis Process
1. Receive task analysis request from Orchestrator
2. Parse task description to extract key attributes
3. Classify task by type, domain, technology, and complexity
4. Generate a task requirement profile
5. Return detailed analysis to the Orchestrator

### Agent Matching Process
1. Receive agent matching request with task analysis
2. Retrieve current agent registry and capability information
3. Score each agent against the task requirements
4. Consider current agent workload and availability
5. Return ranked list of suitable agents or recommendation for new agent

### New Agent Specification
1. Determine that no existing agent is suitable for a task
2. Generate role and persona specifications for a new agent
3. Define required capabilities and knowledge domains
4. Create a complete agent specification
5. Return specification to the Orchestrator for agent creation

## 🧠 Analysis Algorithms

The Analyzer employs several algorithms for task analysis:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Extract key attributes from task descriptions
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common task patterns based on historical data
3. **Semantic Similarity**: Compare task requirements with agent capabilities
4. **Workload Balancing**: Consider agent capacity in assignment decisions
5. **Specialization Scoring**: Weight highly specialized agents over generalists for matching tasks

## 🔌 Interfaces

### Input Interfaces
1. **MCP Client Interface**: Receives analysis requests from the Orchestrator
2. **Agent Registry Interface**: Receives updates about agent capabilities

### Output Interfaces
1. **MCP Server Interface**: Returns analysis results to the Orchestrator
2. **Logging Interface**: Records analysis activities and decisions

## ⚙️ Configuration

The Analyzer Agent requires the following configuration:

```yaml
# Analyzer Agent Configuration
agent:
  name: "analyzer"
  profile: "analyzer"
  debug_flags: "--verbose --debug --mcp-debug"

mcp:
  server_port: 8001
  client_endpoints:
    orchestrator: "http://localhost:8000"

analysis:
  algorithms:
    nlp: "advanced"
    matching_threshold: 0.75
    specialization_weight: 0.6
    workload_weight: 0.4
  
capability_database:
  update_frequency: "hourly"
  learning_rate: 0.05
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance, the Analyzer Agent:

1. Caches recent analysis results for similar tasks
2. Uses progressive analysis depth based on task complexity
3. Continuously updates its capability model based on agent performance
4. Implements parallel analysis of different task aspects
5. Prioritizes analysis requests based on task urgency
