## 📖 Description

The Tester Agent is a specialized Claude Code instance dedicated to test creation, validation, and maintenance. It functions as both an MCP server and client, collaborating with Developer Agents and other specialists in the multi-agent system. This agent focuses exclusively on defining test cases, implementing tests, verifying test coverage, and ensuring quality across the development lifecycle for various programming languages and frameworks. The Tester Agent is designed to support and enhance the Test-Driven Development approach that guides the entire system.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Tester Agent integrates with the broader multi-agent system through the following architecture:

## 🔄 Testing Workflow

The Tester Agent follows a structured workflow for testing tasks:

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Analyze functional and non-functional requirements
   - Identify testable aspects and acceptance criteria
   - Document testing constraints and assumptions

2. **Test Strategy Development**:
   - Define testing approach (unit, integration, system, etc.)
   - Identify key test scenarios and priorities
   - Select appropriate testing frameworks and tools

3. **Test Case Creation**:
   - Design test cases with clear inputs and expected outputs
   - Include positive scenarios (normal operation)
   - Include negative scenarios (error handling)
   - Account for edge cases and boundary conditions

4. **Test Implementation**:
   - Write automated tests using appropriate frameworks
   - Create test fixtures, mocks, and stubs as needed
   - Implement data generators for parameterized tests
   - Structure tests for readability and maintainability

5. **Test Execution and Analysis**:
   - Execute test suite and collect results
   - Analyze test coverage across code base
   - Identify untested or under-tested areas
   - Report bugs and issues with clear reproduction steps

6. **Test Maintenance**:
   - Update tests when requirements change
   - Refactor tests for improved clarity and efficiency
   - Eliminate flaky or non-deterministic tests
   - Document test suite for future reference

```bash
# Test strategy development function
function develop_test_strategy() {
  requirements="$1"
  
  # Generate test strategy
  cat << EOF
# Test Strategy for $(echo "$requirements" | jq -r '.title')

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the requirements described. 
The strategy aims to ensure comprehensive validation of all functionality.

## Test Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
- **System Testing**: Testing the complete feature end-to-end
- **Performance Testing**: Validating performance characteristics

## Test Categories
1. **Functional Tests**: Verify feature works as specified
2. **Negative Tests**: Verify appropriate handling of invalid inputs
3. **Edge Case Tests**: Verify behavior at boundary conditions
4. **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality isn't broken

## Test Execution Strategy
Tests will be executed in the following order:
1. Unit tests during development (TDD approach)
2. Integration tests after component completion
3. System tests after feature integration
4. Performance tests before final approval

## Test Coverage Targets
- Line coverage: >85%
- Branch coverage: >80%
- Function coverage: 100%

## Testing Tools and Frameworks
$(recommend_testing_frameworks "$(echo "$requirements" | jq -r '.language')")
EOF
}
```

## 📊 Test Coverage and Quality

The Tester Agent implements comprehensive coverage analysis and quality metrics:

1. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - Line coverage
   - Branch coverage
   - Function/method coverage
   - Condition coverage
   - Path coverage

2. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Test reliability (flakiness detection)
   - Test isolation
   - Test maintainability
   - Assertion effectiveness
   - Mocking appropriateness

3. **Coverage Reporting**:
   - Visual coverage maps
   - Trend analysis over time
   - Coverage gap identification
   - Risk assessment based on coverage

```bash
# Coverage analysis function
function analyze_test_coverage() {
  code_path="$1"
  test_path="$2"
  language="$3"
  
  # Determine coverage tool based on language
  case "$language" in
    "python")
      coverage_tool="pytest --cov=$code_path $test_path"
      ;;
    "javascript")
      coverage_tool="jest --coverage"
      ;;
    "java")
      coverage_tool="./gradlew jacocoTestReport"
      ;;
    "go")
      coverage_tool="go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./..."
      ;;
    *)
      coverage_tool="echo 'Coverage analysis not supported for $language'"
      ;;
  esac
  
  # Run coverage analysis
  coverage_output=$(eval "$coverage_tool")
  
  # Parse and analyze results
  # [Implementation details for parsing different coverage formats]
  
  # Generate summary report
  cat << EOF
# Test Coverage Analysis

## Summary
- Line Coverage: $line_coverage%
- Branch Coverage: $branch_coverage%
- Function Coverage: $function_coverage%

## Coverage Gaps

```

## 🧩 Testing Strategies

The Tester Agent employs various testing strategies based on the context:

1. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**:
   - Uses Given-When-Then format
   - Focuses on business behavior
   - Bridges technical and non-technical stakeholders

2. **Property-Based Testing**:
   - Generates random inputs based on constraints
   - Verifies properties that should hold true
   - Discovers edge cases automatically

3. **Mutation Testing**:
   - Introduces small changes (mutations) to code
   - Verifies that tests fail when code is mutated
   - Measures test effectiveness

4. **Snapshot Testing**:
   - Captures expected outputs as snapshots
   - Useful for UI components and complex objects
   - Identifies unexpected changes

5. **Contract Testing**:
   - Verifies API contracts between components
   - Ensures integration compatibility
   - Focuses on boundaries between systems

```bash
# Testing strategy recommendation function
function recommend_testing_strategy() {
  context="$1"
  
  if [[ "$context" == *"UI"* || "$context" == *"frontend"* ]]; then
    # Frontend/UI context
    cat << EOF
## Recommended Testing Strategy: Component and Visual Testing

For this UI component, I recommend:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test component logic in isolation
2. **Snapshot Testing**: Capture and verify component rendering
3. **Interaction Testing**: Simulate user interactions and verify behavior
4. **Visual Regression Testing**: Detect unintended visual changes

This approach ensures both functional correctness and visual consistency.
EOF
  elif [[ "$context" == *"API"* || "$context" == *"service"* ]]; then
    # API/Service context
    cat << EOF
## Recommended Testing Strategy: API and Integration Testing

For this service implementation, I recommend:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test internal logic and edge cases
2. **Contract Testing**: Verify API adheres to its contract
3. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions with dependencies
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify response times and throughput

This approach ensures the service meets its functional and non-functional requirements.
EOF
  elif [[ "$context" == *"algorithm"* || "$context" == *"data"* ]]; then
    # Algorithm/Data processing context
    cat << EOF
## Recommended Testing Strategy: Property-Based and Scenario Testing

For this algorithm implementation, I recommend:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test with known inputs and outputs
2. **Property-Based Testing**: Generate random inputs to verify invariants
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify time and space complexity
4. **Benchmark Testing**: Compare against existing implementations

This approach ensures correctness across a wide range of inputs and performance characteristics.
EOF
  else
    # General context
    cat << EOF
## Recommended Testing Strategy: Comprehensive Functional Testing

For this implementation, I recommend:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
3. **System Testing**: Test end-to-end functionality
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Verify boundary conditions

This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of functionality and edge cases.

    def test_should_handle_error_condition(self):
        # Arrange
        invalid_input = None
        
        # Act/Assert
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            self.subject.process(invalid_input)
            
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("input_value,expected_output", [
