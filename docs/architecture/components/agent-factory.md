## 📋 Overview

The Agent Factory is responsible for creating new specialized Claude Code agents when the system needs additional capabilities. It translates high-level agent specifications into concrete Claude Code instances with appropriate configuration, system prompts, and MCP settings.

## 🔑 Responsibilities

The Agent Factory is responsible for:

1. **Agent Creation**: Instantiating new Claude Code instances based on specifications
2. **Profile Generation**: Creating appropriate system profiles for each agent role
3. **Configuration Management**: Setting up MCP server/client configurations
4. **Agent Registration**: Registering new agents with the Orchestrator
5. **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Monitoring and managing agent lifecycle events
6. **Agent Template Management**: Maintaining a library of agent templates

## 🧩 Component Architecture

The Agent Factory consists of several subcomponents:

1. **Template Library**: Stores reusable agent templates for different roles
2. **Profile Generator**: Creates custom system prompts for agent personas
3. **Configuration Manager**: Manages Claude Code instance configurations
4. **Process Controller**: Launches and monitors Claude Code processes
5. **Registration Service**: Registers new agents with the Orchestrator
6. **Health Monitor**: Tracks agent health and status

## 🔄 Core Workflows

### Agent Creation Workflow
1. Receive agent creation request with specifications
2. Select appropriate base template for the requested role
3. Customize template based on specific requirements
4. Generate system profile with appropriate persona
5. Configure MCP server/client settings
6. Launch new Claude Code instance with the configuration
7. Verify agent is operational
8. Register agent with the Orchestrator
9. Return agent connection details

### Agent Lifecycle Management
1. Monitor running agent processes
2. Handle agent startup, shutdown, and restart events
3. Detect and report agent health issues
4. Facilitate agent updates when needed
5. Maintain agent process inventory

### Template Management
1. Store and version agent templates
2. Update templates based on performance feedback
3. Create new templates for novel agent types
4. Optimize templates for specific task domains
5. Manage template dependencies

## 👤 Agent Templates

The Agent Factory maintains templates for various specialized roles:

1. **Developer Templates**:
   - Frontend Developer
   - Backend Developer
   - Full-Stack Developer
   - Mobile Developer

2. **Specialized Role Templates**:
   - Tester
   - Reviewer
   - Documentation Specialist
   - DevOps Engineer
   - Database Specialist
   - Security Expert

3. **Domain-Specific Templates**:
   - Web Application Specialist
   - Data Processing Specialist
   - API Integration Specialist
   - Machine Learning Engineer

## 🔌 Interfaces

### Input Interfaces
1. **MCP Client Interface**: Receives agent creation requests
2. **Admin API**: Receives template management commands

### Output Interfaces
1. **MCP Server Interface**: Communicates agent status and events
2. **Process Management Interface**: Controls Claude Code processes
3. **Logging Interface**: Records factory activities

## ⚙️ Configuration

The Agent Factory requires the following configuration:

```yaml
# Agent Factory Configuration
agent:
  name: "agent-factory"
  profile: "agent-factory"
  debug_flags: "--verbose --debug --mcp-debug"

mcp:
  server_port: 8002
  client_endpoints:
    orchestrator: "http://localhost:8000"

templates:
  directory: "/templates"
  version_control: true
  
process:
  max_agents: 20
  base_port: 8100
  log_directory: "/logs/agents"
  
security:
  restricted_commands: true
  isolation_level: "process"
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

The Agent Factory implements several security measures:

1. **Process Isolation**: Each agent runs in an isolated process
2. **Command Restrictions**: Limits available commands for created agents
3. **Resource Quotas**: Applies resource limits to prevent overutilization
4. **Access Controls**: Restricts agent access to system resources
5. **Secure Configuration**: Manages sensitive configuration data securely
