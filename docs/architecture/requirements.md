## 🤖 Agent Infrastructure
1. All agents will be Claude Code instances running as both Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients
2. All Claude instances must run with maximum level of debug enabled:
   ```bash
   --verbose --debug --mcp-debug
   ```
3. Agent configurations must be persisted and reusable
4. Implementation should use shell scripts rather than Python where possible

## 👤 Agent Roles & Personas
1. Each agent will be assigned a specific role/persona using the system profile CLI option
2. Personas will define agent specializations and capabilities
3. Agents must operate according to their defined roles
4. Agents should strictly adhere to their specialized role and never work outside their domain

## 🔄 Task Management
1. Tasks will be managed as GitHub issues with applicable tags using the GitHub CLI (gh)
2. Complete task lifecycle must be managed within the system
3. Tasks will require metadata for proper routing and processing
4. System will use a Kanban-style approach for task management
5. Tasks can be of any type and complexity (software development, literature, science, etc.)
6. The system must support domain-agnostic task processing while maintaining agent specialization
7. Tasks must include links to relevant documentation and process guidelines
8. Related tasks must be linked through GitHub's relationship features:
   - Parent-child relationships for task decomposition
   - Dependency relationships for blockers and prerequisites
   - Reference relationships for related work
9. Tasks created in relation to other tasks must link to their "parent" tasks
10. Tasks that are decomposed into smaller subtasks must reference those subtasks
11. Tasks must reference their associated project (if applicable)

## 📊 Task Distribution
1. The system must analyze incoming tasks and match them with corresponding agents
2. Task matching should consider agent specializations and current workload
3. Task distribution should be optimized for efficiency and throughput
4. Agents should pull tasks rather than having tasks pushed to them

## 🧠 Agent Creation
1. If no existing agent is a good match for a task, the system should create a new agent
2. New agent profiles should include appropriate role/persona definitions via system prompt
3. Agent creation process should be automated and standardized
4. Directory structure for agent configurations should follow a hierarchical organization pattern

## 💻 Development Methodology
1. All work on all types of tasks should follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) process
2. Appropriate adaptations of TDD should be made for different task types
3. Agents should be able to create, update, comment on, and tag GitHub issues like human users

## ♻️ Agent Lifecycle Management
1. The system should be able to spawn agent instances on-demand
2. Agents should pull tasks using a Kanban approach from GitHub issues
3. Agents should terminate after task completion to optimize resource usage
4. If a task is not feasible, agents should be able to update the task or create a new task for another agent type

## 💰 Tenant Cost Tracking
1. The system must support multiple tenants with accurate cost tracking
2. Cost data must be collected at all stages of agent lifecycle
3. Tenant costs should be attributable to specific agents and tasks
4. The system should provide reporting and visualization capabilities for cost analysis
5. Cost thresholds and alerts should be configurable per tenant

## 🧩 Design Principles
1. All agents and processes must follow SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles
2. Each agent should have a single responsibility (e.g., a poet agent should never write essays)
3. Components should be modular and reusable
4. System should prioritize simplicity over complexity
5. Implementation should use minimal dependencies

## 🏢 Organizational Model
1. The system should model an efficient human organization rather than complex workflows
2. Favor Claude's reasoning capabilities over rigid process definitions
3. Use prompt-based reasoning for decision making and coordination
4. Rely on Git hooks and scripts for lightweight process guidance
5. Avoid sophisticated workflow engines in favor of natural collaboration patterns
