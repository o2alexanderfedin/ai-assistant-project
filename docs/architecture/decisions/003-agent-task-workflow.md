## üìñ Context

In our multi-agent system, each agent specializes in particular domains and functions. Without a standardized approach to handling tasks, agents might process tasks inconsistently, resulting in several issues:

1. Different documentation practices creating confusion
2. Incomplete task decomposition leading to missed requirements
3. Inefficient task handling due to lack of partial work identification
4. Inconsistent yielding back to the orchestrator
5. Disorganized question handling causing communication gaps

We need a standardized workflow that all agents must follow when handling tasks to ensure consistency, traceability, and optimal collaboration while still allowing for agent specialization in their specific domains.

## üöÄ Decision

**We will implement a standardized Agent Task Workflow that all agents must follow when processing tasks.**

This workflow will standardize:
1. Initial task analysis
2. Partial work identification and execution
3. Task decomposition practices
4. Documentation requirements
5. Question handling
6. Yielding back to orchestrator

Each agent will maintain its specialized capabilities and domain expertise but will follow this standardized workflow for consistent task processing across the system.

## üîÑ Workflow Process

The standardized workflow consists of these key steps:

1. **Task Analysis**: Agents thoroughly analyze task requirements, complexity, and scope.

2. **Partial Work Assessment & Execution**: If any partial work can be completed immediately, the agent will do so and document progress.

3. **Decomposition Decision & Execution**: The agent determines if task requires decomposition and creates subtasks if needed.

4. **Documentation**: All work done and/or decomposition is documented thoroughly.

5. **Status Update**: Task status is updated to reflect current state.

6. **Question Handling**: If questions arise, they are documented in the task and a specific question subtask is created.

7. **Yield to Orchestrator**: The agent yields back control after completing its portion of work.

This workflow is fully documented in the [Agent Task Workflow](../components/agent-task-workflow.md) component specification.

## üí° Rationale

A standardized workflow across all agents provides several advantages:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures all tasks are handled in a predictable, consistent manner regardless of which agent processes them.

2. **Traceability**: Creates a clear, uniform audit trail of task processing steps.

3. **Efficiency**: Encourages partial work completion and proper task decomposition for optimal resource utilization.

4. **Coordination**: Facilitates better coordination between agents through standardized documentation and status updates.

5. **Quality**: Enforces proper documentation practices across the system.

6. **Scalability**: Makes it easier to onboard new agent types as they can adopt the standard workflow.

7. **Observability**: Simplifies monitoring and debugging by providing consistent patterns to track.

## üßÆ Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Better Task Tracking**: Standardized status updates and documentation make tracking task progress easier.

2. **Improved Collaboration**: Agents can better understand and build upon each other's work.

3. **Enhanced Decomposition**: Tasks are broken down more effectively, enabling parallel processing.

4. **Clearer Communication**: Standardized question handling improves clarity in agent communication.

5. **Consistent Documentation**: All tasks receive thorough and consistent documentation.

6. **Optimized Resource Usage**: Partial work completion and efficient yielding improve resource utilization.

### Negative Consequences

1. **Initial Overhead**: Agents must implement the standardized workflow, requiring additional code.

2. **Process Rigidity**: Some flexibility is sacrificed for standardization.

3. **Training Requirements**: Agents must be trained to follow the standard workflow.

4. **Potential Over-documentation**: For simple tasks, the full workflow may create unnecessary documentation.

## üîç Alternatives Considered

### 1. Agent-Specific Workflows

**Approach**: Allow each agent type to define its own task handling workflow.

**Benefits**:
- Maximum flexibility for each agent type
- Potentially more efficient for specialized domains

**Drawbacks**:
- Inconsistent documentation and status updates
- Difficult coordination between agent types
- Harder to monitor and debug
- Increased complexity for orchestrator

### 2. Minimal Shared Interface

**Approach**: Define only minimal shared interfaces for task reception and completion.

**Benefits**:
- Less implementation overhead
- More agent autonomy

**Drawbacks**:
- Inconsistent documentation quality
- Poor task decomposition
- Inefficient handling of questions and blockers
- Limited traceability

### 3. Fully Centralized Processing

**Approach**: Centralize all task processing logic in the orchestrator.

**Benefits**:
- Maximum control over processing
- Consistent handling guaranteed

**Drawbacks**:
- Bottleneck at orchestrator
- Reduced agent autonomy
- Undermines the distributed nature of the system
- Less specialized processing

## üß™ Validation

This architecture decision will be validated through:

1. **Implementation Testing**: Implementing the standardized workflow across multiple agent types.

2. **Process Metrics**: Measuring improvements in task completion time, documentation quality, and coordination efficiency.

3. **User Feedback**: Gathering feedback on task tracking and visibility improvements.

4. **Agent Performance**: Comparing agent performance metrics before and after standardization.

5. **System Audits**: Conducting audits of task processing to verify consistency.
