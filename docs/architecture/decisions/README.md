## 📋 Overview

This directory contains architecture decision records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the multi-agent system. Each decision is documented with context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

## 📝 Decision Records

- [ADR-001: Agent Communication Protocol](./001-agent-communication-protocol.md) - Decision to use MCP for inter-agent communication
- [ADR-002: GitHub Integration Strategy](./002-github-integration-strategy.md) - Centralized approach for GitHub integration
- [ADR-003: Agent Task Workflow Standardization](./003-agent-task-workflow.md) - Standardized workflow for all agent task handling

Planned decisions:
- ADR-004: TDD Workflow Implementation
- ADR-005: Agent Specialization Strategy
- ADR-006: Deployment and Scaling Approach

## 📊 Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Options | Selected Approach | Key Factors |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Communication | File-based, Queue-based, MCP, Direct API | MCP | Native support, bidirectional, debugging |
| GitHub Integration | Direct access, CLI, 3rd party, Custom | Centralized service | Rate limits, caching, consistent interface |
| Task Workflow | Agent-specific, Minimal interface, Centralized, Standardized | Standardized workflow | Consistency, traceability, coordination |
| TDD Implementation | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Agent Creation | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Deployment | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## 🔄 Decision Process

Architecture decisions follow this process:

1. **Identification**: Identify a significant architectural decision needed
2. **Research**: Investigate alternatives and their implications
3. **Evaluation**: Assess options against requirements and constraints
4. **Decision**: Select an approach with clear rationale
5. **Documentation**: Create an ADR documenting the decision
6. **Review**: Review the decision with stakeholders
7. **Implementation**: Implement according to the decided approach
8. **Validation**: Evaluate the decision against real-world results
9. **Refinement**: Refine the approach based on experience
