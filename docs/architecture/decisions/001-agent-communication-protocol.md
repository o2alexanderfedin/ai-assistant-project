## 📋 Context

The multi-agent system requires a robust and flexible communication protocol for agents to exchange information, delegate tasks, and coordinate activities. Since all agents will be Claude Code instances, we need to determine the most effective way for them to communicate with each other.

## 🤔 Decision

**We will use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the primary communication mechanism between agents, with each agent operating as both an MCP server and client.**

Key aspects of this decision:

1. All Claude Code instances will be configured with MCP server capabilities
2. Each agent will expose a REST API via MCP that other agents can call
3. Maximum debug verbosity will be enabled for all MCP communication
4. A standardized message format will be defined for inter-agent communication
5. Communication will follow a defined message routing scheme

## 💭 Alternatives Considered

1. **File-Based Communication**:
   - Agents could write to and read from shared files
   - Would be simpler to implement but less efficient

2. **Queue-Based Communication**:
   - Use a message queue service (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)
   - Would provide more reliability but add complexity and dependencies

3. **Direct API Calls**:
   - Implement custom API endpoints for each agent
   - Would provide more flexibility but require more development

4. **Shared Database**:
   - All agents read/write to a shared database
   - Would simplify state management but introduce synchronization challenges

## ✅ Pros

1. **Native Integration**: MCP is natively supported by Claude Code instances
2. **Bidirectional Communication**: Enables both request/response and pub/sub patterns
3. **Debugging Support**: The extensive debug modes provide visibility into all communication
4. **Simplified Setup**: No additional services or infrastructure required
5. **Standardized Protocol**: Consistent message format across all agent types
6. **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation context when needed

## ⚠️ Cons

1. **Performance Overhead**: MCP communication may have higher latency than alternatives
2. **Debugging Complexity**: Verbose debug logs require additional processing for monitoring
3. **Connection Management**: Requires handling of connection failures and retries
4. **Potential Deadlocks**: Circular dependencies could cause deadlocks if not managed
5. **Resource Usage**: Running multiple MCP servers requires careful resource allocation

## 🔄 Implementation Strategy

The implementation will proceed in these phases:

1. **Phase 1: Base Protocol Definition**
   - Define the standard message format
   - Implement base MCP server/client functionality
   - Create message validation and routing

2. **Phase 2: Agent Integration**
   - Integrate protocol into core agent components
   - Implement agent-specific message handlers
   - Create communication patterns for key workflows

3. **Phase 3: Monitoring and Optimization**
   - Add comprehensive logging for all MCP traffic
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Optimize message processing and routing

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

Success will be measured by these criteria:

1. **Reliability**: >99.9% message delivery success rate
2. **Performance**: Average message round-trip time <500ms
3. **Scalability**: Support for 20+ concurrent agents
4. **Debugging**: Complete visibility into all inter-agent communication
5. **Flexibility**: Ability to add new message types without protocol changes
6. **Simplicity**: New agents can be integrated with minimal configuration
