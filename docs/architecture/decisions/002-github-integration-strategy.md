## 📋 Context

The multi-agent system requires a standardized approach for task management. The requirements specify that tasks should be managed as GitHub issues, and agents should be able to interact with these issues like human users. We need to determine the most effective approach for this integration.

## 🤔 Decision

**We will implement a centralized GitHub integration service that provides a unified interface for all agents to interact with GitHub, using GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs with a shared authentication mechanism.**

Key aspects of this decision:

1. A dedicated GitHub connector component will handle all interactions with GitHub
2. Agents will use a standardized interface to perform GitHub operations
3. Authentication will be managed centrally, with agents operating under their own identities
4. Webhooks will be used to monitor GitHub events in real-time
5. A local cache will maintain state and reduce API calls

## 💭 Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct API Access by Each Agent**:
   - Each agent would independently access GitHub's API
   - Would be simpler but lead to duplication and potential rate limit issues

2. **Git CLI Operations**:
   - Use git commands and GitHub CLI for operations
   - Would leverage existing tools but be more complex to manage

3. **Third-Party GitHub Integration Service**:
   - Use a service like Zapier or n8n for GitHub integration
   - Would reduce development effort but add external dependencies

4. **Custom GitHub App**:
   - Develop a dedicated GitHub App for the system
   - Would provide better security but increase development complexity

## ✅ Pros

1. **Centralized Authentication**: Simplified management of GitHub credentials
2. **API Rate Limit Management**: Consolidated handling of GitHub's rate limits
3. **Consistent Interface**: Standardized methods for all GitHub operations
4. **Efficient Caching**: Reduced API calls through shared caching
5. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via webhook events
6. **Identity Management**: Agents can operate with distinct GitHub identities

## ⚠️ Cons

1. **Single Point of Failure**: Centralized service creates a potential bottleneck
2. **Implementation Complexity**: Requires comprehensive coverage of GitHub's APIs
3. **Authentication Challenges**: Managing multiple agent identities adds complexity
4. **Webhook Management**: Requires secure webhook endpoint and event processing
5. **Cache Consistency**: Maintaining consistent cache state across components

## 🔄 Implementation Strategy

The implementation will proceed in these phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core API Integration**
   - Implement essential GitHub API operations
   - Set up authentication and identity management
   - Create the base interface for agents

2. **Phase 2: Webhook Integration**
   - Implement webhook endpoint and event processing
   - Create event subscription mechanism for agents
   - Develop event-based workflows

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Implement caching layer for improved performance
   - Add advanced GitHub features (code review, CI integration)
   - Create agent-specific GitHub operation helpers

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

Success will be measured by these criteria:

1. **API Coverage**: Support for all required GitHub operations
2. **Performance**: Response time for GitHub operations <1s on average
3. **Reliability**: >99.5% success rate for GitHub API calls
4. **Rate Limit Management**: Zero rate limit exceeded errors
5. **Event Processing**: <5s latency for webhook event processing
6. **Usability**: Agents can perform all required GitHub interactions
