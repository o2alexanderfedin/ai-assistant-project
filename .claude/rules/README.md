## 🔍 When to Use Rules

Rules should be consulted when:
1. Facing a technical challenge that might have been solved before
2. Implementing features that interact with external APIs
3. Encountering error messages from third-party systems
4. Looking for established patterns to solve common problems
5. Making design decisions about architecture or documentation

## 🚀 Purpose

These rules serve as standardized patterns for solving common problems and ensuring consistency across the project. They are designed to:

1. **Enhance Consistency** - Ensure all team members follow the same standards and practices
2. **Document Best Practices** - Capture proven solutions for reference
3. **Improve Efficiency** - Reduce time spent on common decisions
4. **Facilitate Onboarding** - Help new team members understand project norms

## 🛠️ How to Create a New Rule

Follow these steps to add a new rule:
1. Solve the problem and verify your solution works
2. Document the solution following the template in `rule-creation-policy.md`
3. Name the file descriptively using kebab-case
4. Add the rule to this README.md file

## 🔄 Rule Maintenance

Rules should be updated when:
- APIs or services they document change
- Better solutions are found
- Additional context or error cases are discovered
- Related rules are created
